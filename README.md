# Sequence-Fun
-----------------------------------
Online Python Challenge
-----------------------------------

You have a sequence 2,5,16,65,........Given an integer n as input . You have to find the value at nth position in the sequence.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 4

Output: 65

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 2:

Input: n = 10

Output: 9864101
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read or print anything, Your task is to complete the function NthTerm() which takes n as input parameter and retruns value at nth position of the given sequence modulo 109 + 7.
 

Expected Time Compelxity:  O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 104
